For Switch version only!

Work in progress.
I decided to write this program just to see if I could and also because as far as I'm aware, there isn't a save editor for this game out there. This was made using the very limited C# knowledge I gained from one semester of college and lots of Googling, so expect the code to be extremely unoptimized. Hopefully someone out there will see this mess and decide to make something better of it :)  If not, I'll probably keep working on it until I'm happy with the features.
